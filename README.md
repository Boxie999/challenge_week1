# <Refactored html for Horiseon web application>
It contains the refactored html document for Horiseon webpage.
## Description


The goal was to make this website more accessibble, by refactoring the existing codes.
I added alt attributes to the images and icons, so it's also more accessible for visually impaired people for example. 
I also created an anchor link on the page, for the "search engine optimization" button in the nav bar, because it wasn't working in the starter code. 
I added a title for the webpage, because that was missing.
I used semantic html elements throughout the document.
I polished down the css file sheet, because it was repeating itself and was too long, so
I grouped some elements which had the same attributes and made it more DRY.
I left comments in the html document and in the css file sheet, about all the changes I made. 
  
  - refactored html document 
  - refactored css style sheet
  - css selectors and properties follow semantic structure
  - css and html files are properly commented
  - repository follows best practices for file structure and naming conventions
  - website is accessible
  - html document contains semantic elements
